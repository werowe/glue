[Generate Samples Sales and Order Data in PostgreSQL](https://github.com/werowe/glue/blob/master/inventory%20sysystem.ipynb) demonstrates how to programmatically generate and insert synthetic customer and sales order data into a PostgreSQL database using Python. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

---

### 1. Imports and Utility Functions

- Imports necessary libraries for date/time (`datetime`), unique ID generation (`uuid`), random numbers (`random`), Java-based database connectivity (`jaydebeapi`), and OS operations.
- Defines simple helpers:
  - `getToday()`: Returns the current date as an ISO string.
  - `generateSQL(tablename, columns, values)`: Assembles an `INSERT INTO` SQL command for a given table, columns, and value strings.
  - `generateJSON(columns, values)`: Intended to build a dict for columns/values, but has structural issues in the provided code.
  - `randomString(length)`: Generates a random lowercase ASCII string of specified length.
  - `commaCheck(field)`: Converts fields to string format appropriate for SQL insertion depending on type.

---

### 2. Entity Classes

#### Customer
- The `Customer` class represents a single customer, with fields for customer number (UUID), name, phone, postal code, locale, date created, and email.
- On instantiation, populates each field with random or deterministic values and also generates between 1–5 random sales orders associated with this customer.
- Has methods to return the list of columns, values (for SQL), and associated sales orders.

#### SalesOrder
- Represents an order associated with a customer.
- Populates order fields (order number, comments, dates, type, quantity, etc.) with random or deterministic values upon instantiation.
- Methods return column names and value lists for SQL insertion.

*Database table schemas are included as comments to match these classes.*

### 3. Database Connection

- The `connect()` function sets up a JDBC database connection to a PostgreSQL instance using `jaydebeapi` and a local JDBC driver JAR file.
- The connection parameters (hostname, port, user, password, DB name) are hard-coded.
- Returns a connection object.

---

### 4. Data Generation and Insertion

- `generateCustomers(conn)`: Creates 2000 customers, generates a corresponding SQL `INSERT` for each and inserts it into the `customers` table, then calls `generateOrders()` for every associated sales order.
- `generateOrders(orders, conn)`: For each order, generates and executes an SQL `INSERT` to the `orders` table.

---

### 5. Execution

- The `main()` function connects to the database and invokes `generateCustomers()`, triggering the customer and order data generation and insertion process.
- The script's `__main__` block calls `main()` to start the process when run as a standalone program.

---

### Summary

- **Purpose:** Populate a PostgreSQL inventory database with randomly generated mock "customers" and their related "sales orders".
- **Features:** 
  - Automatic table insert SQL and data generation.
  - Class-based organization for clarity and extensibility.
  - Supports generating thousands of randomized records, creating a robust test set for demos, development, or benchmarking.
- **Notes:** 
  - Actual execution requires PostgreSQL with the correct schema, a working JDBC connector, and valid file paths/user credentials for your environment.
  - Some code sections (JSON function, randomString integration, error handling) may need further refinement to be production-ready.

This serves as an automated test data loader and can be adapted for other relational databases or schemas with minor changes.
